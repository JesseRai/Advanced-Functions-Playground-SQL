SQL Function Experiments

This folder is just me playing around with SQL and testing different functions. Nothing polished, just a space to try things out and see how they work.

What’s inside

Scripts using window functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LEAD, LAG

Practice with CTEs and joins

Aggregations and grouping experiments

Random queries I wrote to see what happens

Why

Mainly for practice and quick reference. If the queries look messy, that’s because they are — this is more of a scratchpad than a finished project.
